"],["introduction.html", "2 Introduction 2.1 Rationale for presenting model results", " 2 Introduction This document describes the content, methods, and limitations/caveats associated with the species models developed by the ABMI. Species models are currently accessible in two locations: Data &amp; Analytics Portal (http://www.abmi.ca/home/data-analytics; launched December 2016): The ABMI Data &amp; Analytics (DA) Portal was developed, and is maintained by the ABMI Information Centre. This portal serves to present a variety of ABMI data and mapping products and allows users to access and interact with ABMI data in a variety of ways. Species Development Website (https://science.abmi.ca/): The ABMI Species Development Website was developed, and is maintained by the ABMI Science Centre. This site allows for the Science Centre to review our species models before making them available on the Data &amp; Analytics Portal. We recommend that users only use the information available on the Data &amp; Analytics Portal or through our R packages (e.g., wildRtrax, allinone). 2.1 Rationale for presenting model results The ABMI collects data on thousands of species and evaluates how their relative abundance varies among natural and human-created habitats. It is a core mission of the ABMI to make both the raw data and model results available for public use. However, some species are not well detected using the ABMI sampling method, others are detected a few times, while some species have habitat models which produce implausible results. Therefore this document aims to improve the transparency around how our raw species data is used to create habitat models. "],["species-models.html", "3 Species Models 3.1 Sample size 3.2 Full habitat models for relatively common species, systematic terrestrial sites 3.3 Use-availability summaries for rarer species", " 3 Species Models 3.1 Sample size ABMI conducts separate analysis for two regions: the Northern (Boreal, Canadian shield, Foothills and Rocky Mountain natural regions) which is vegetation-based and the Southern (Grassland, Parkland and Dry Mixedwood regions) which is soil based. The vegetation-based models require on average 20 degrees of freedom (df) with habitat/age/climate terms in the models. The soil-based models require on average 10 df with soil/climate terms in the model. Species habitat models are created for all species that occur in at least 20 locations within the anlaysis regions. 3.1.1 Sampling design adequacy and detection issue ABMI is designed to determine habitat association and track population trend for common species. The chosen sampling methods, however, do not capture all species effectively, including species that live in rare patchy habitats. Vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens. A number of species belonging to these taxa are inadequately sampled or detected, because: Survey season is not optimized (too early/too late) to sample the species when their characteristic features (flowers, seeds) for field identification are available to distinguish them from similar species in the field. Problematic vascular plants are downgraded to genus or family level in the data. Survey protocol is not designed to sample them (e.g., crustose lichens). Species is part of taxonomically complex groups which makes it difficult to distinguish them. This applies particularly for lichens and bryophytes, and a few vascular plants. These species are analysed at genus level or species group level. 3.2 Full habitat models for relatively common species, systematic terrestrial sites Models are used to show how species relative abundance differed among vegetation, soil and, human footprint types in the northern and southern regions of Alberta. Models were only created for species that had enough detections. The following figures are presented to describe habitat associations: Specieshabitat associations in northern Alberta. Predicted species abundance in each vegetation and human footprint type is shown with bars. Vertical lines indicate 90% confidence intervals. Light green bars within the forested habitat types show predicted species abundance in forest harvest areas of various ages. Vegetation based habitat model for an example species. Specieshabitat associations in southern Alberta. Due to climate and soil conditions, natural disturbances and vegetation succession, varying amounts of aspen and other trees may be present on each soil type in the south (Non-treed sites and Treed sites); the presence/absence of trees greatly affects the presence and abundance of many other biota. Separate figures are presented for south Non-treed sites and Treed sites. Predicted species abundance in each soil/human footprint type is shown with bars. Vertical lines indicate 90% confidence intervals. Soil based habitat model an example species. 3.2.1 Methods Relative abundance for vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens is the probability that the species will occur in a 50m x 50m ABMI quadrat, or a soil sample for mites. These are the values on the y-axis of the habitat model figures (above), and in the coefficient tables (allinone repository). We also model the number of non-native vascular plant species, besides individual vascular plant species. Vegetation types in the North region are based on several province-wide GIS layers of vegetation variables, and include main forest stand types (white spruce, pine, deciduous, mixedwood, black spruce) by broad age classes (0-9 years, 10-19 years, then 20-year classes to 140+ years) and several categories of open vegetation (larch fens, upland grass, upland shrub, wet grass, and wet shrub). In the South, vegetation types are broad soil types, such as clay, rapid draining, etc. The South models also include a term for the probability that the site is or was naturally treed. Several categories of human footprint are distinguished in the models, including cultivation, urban/industrial, forestry, soft (vegetated) linear features and hard (unvegetated) linear features. Forestry footprint is differentiated by broad stand type and the same age classes as natural forest (although we have few samples in forestry areas &gt;20 years old). Vegetation or soils and human footprint information is summarized for each of the four 50m x 50m quadrats. Flexible relationships with latitude, longitude and a set of broad climate variables are also included in the models to represent the geographic and climatic distribution of the species. The bioclimatic variables used in the modeling were calculated at a 4-km resolution using monthly climate normals of temperature and precipitation averaged over 1961-1990. The analysis is conducted in a model selection framework, which means that the models for each species are only as complex as the data for that species support. For example, the models for a rarer species with few records may not be able to separate different age classes or even broad stand types. All age classes or several stand types therefore have the same average value in the resulting habitat model. This does not mean that there are truly no differences between these types for that species. It just means that we do not yet have enough data to estimate abundances in all those individual vegetation types. This habitat modeling requires moderate sample sizes, so we can only do the analyses for species found in at least 20 sites in an analysis region. 3.2.2 Model output plausibility Once a species meets the minimum detection requirements, visual inspection of the model results is done to evaluate the plausibility of the output. Visual inspection includes: Determining whether habitat associations are compatible with known biology of species. Determining whether confidence intervals in habitat associations are extreme (relative to mean abundance). Determining whether the predicted distribution of the species is compatible with the known spatial distribution of the species (range maps, detections). Once inspection is done, notes are added to the species lookup table and final decisions are made. This way the steps in the evaluation process are transparent and decisions can be re-evaluated if needed. These are incorporated into the species taxonomic information table to make the process and any caveats transparent. 3.2.3 Limitations There are many limitations and caveats about the use of these habitat models: We use simple abundance measures. For vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens and mites, we are only analyzing occurrence of the species at 0-4 of the 4 quadrats or soil samples per site. The number of individuals, percent cover, total volume or biomass, reproductive status, etc. of the species is not part of this measure  a single sapling of a tree species is an occurrence counted as much as complete cover of large trees. There is also no adjustment for the probability that the species was present but was missed by the field technicians. That probability is probably higher in complicated quadrats, species rich habitats, rare species, and for groups of species that are hard to distinguish in the field, all of which could affect the habitat models. There is often high uncertainty in individual values. The confidence intervals on individual habitat values for a species are often wide, and should be integral to any use of the habitat models. There are two main reasons for wide uncertainty in our results: 1) We estimate values for many habitat and human footprint types, particularly in the North, with many combinations of broad stand types and age classes. Ideally we would have hundreds of observations of a species to estimate so many values. Instead, we use a fairly complicated modeling procedure to extract reasonable values for many species with lower sample sizes by simplifying the complexity of habitat types. For all but the most common species, the resulting habitat models are simplified (some habitat types are assumed to be the same) and estimated with large error. 2) ABMI sites are systematically located, and the Alberta land base often contains a fine-scale mix of several habitat types and human footprint. Individual sites, even 1-ha areas, therefore usually fall in more than one habitat and/or human footprint type. Our models are designed to separate out the effects of each individual habitat or human footprint type as best as possible, but the analysis is necessarily imperfect with limited sample sizes. A highly specialized species, for example, will almost inevitably show some predicted abundance in habitat types that it does not use, when these co-occur with preferred habitat types. The explanatory variables are confounded. We have limited ability to separate effects of each vegetation and human footprint type, and spatial and climate variables. In addition to the challenges generating uncertainty in the individual values, ABMI is not an experimental study. We do not design and manipulate habitat and human footprint types, and simply use what is sampled in the province. As a result, habitat and human footprint types are partially confounded with geographic location and climate variables. Our modeling separates out these effects as best as possible, but without impossible province-wide experiments, we can never be sure how well we have estimated the separate habitat, human footprint and geographic/climate effects. We use the same model set for all species. Our model selection approach weights different models in a model set based on the support provided by each species data. However, we use the same set of models for all species. We currently do not have the resources to develop separate model sets for individual species to benefit from the differences in natural history. There are errors in species identification. All taxa have potential for errors in species identification, including the mammal track surveys and the bird recording interpretation. Taxonomic issues are common with the plants, bryophytes, and lichens, where many species groups are difficult to distinguish and taxonomy changes frequently. This adds to uncertainty in models for some species. The vegetation and soil classification is simplified and contains errors. ABMIs vegetation map is compiled from various sources, not all of which cover the entire province. Some layers are less accurate than others. Also, even if individual polygons are accurate, their boundaries may not be precise, and many ABMI sites fall on the edges of vegetation polygons. Resulting error in the vegetation types at sites increases error in the habitat models. Some habitat types may have additional challenges. Grass and shrub sites in the North, for example, may be true permanent open habitats, but the same designation is often given to early seral stages of forested sites after fire. Grass and shrub sites in the prairies are also poorly mapped. Mixedwood stands are also poorly mapped, because they represent a gradient between deciduous and upland conifer stands, which can often change as a stand ages. The soil classification currently uses only broad groupings of individual soil types. Few species show strong responses to soil type in our models, suggesting that these groups may not be well-defined or relevant to many species. We have too few sites to treat lowland sites in the South separately. We have only broad classes of human footprint. Human footprint is generally mapped more precisely than vegetation, but we use only broad groups of footprint types. Industrial sites and urban or rural residential areas, for example, cannot be reliably distinguished. Values are particularly difficult to estimate reliably for linear features, because these usually occupy only a small portion of a site. We also have few sites with older forestry harvest areas. Values for those habitat types combine our rough estimates with an assumed rate of convergence of aging forestry and natural stands. No other effects of human activities are included in our models. Many sites in the South are grazed to varying degrees but this information is not available. Thus grazing effects cannot be included in our models, and if grazing differs among native habitat types the effects confound those difference. Any wide-scale human effects, like pollution away from visible human footprint or recent climate change, are also not included in our modeling. Additionally, we only include effects of footprint at the local scale  the 1-ha scale we sample at, or larger sampling areas for birds and mammals. Due to sample size constraints and confounding among variables, we do not include any additional effects that might be caused by human footprint in the larger surrounding area. 3.3 Use-availability summaries for rarer species If it was not possible to create complex habitat association models for species, we present a coarse index of habitat use the proportion of detections in each native vegetation and human footprint type in comparison to the proportional availability of the habitat types. 3.3.1 Methods ABMI has information on many species that are detected too few times for full habitat models. For species detected at 3 or more sites but less than 20 sites, we summarize habitat and human footprint use with a simple use-availability index. The index is based on the proportions of each broad habitat or human footprint type in the sites where the species is present versus the proportions of habitat and human footprint type across all sites that we have sampled. A value of 0 for a habitat type means that the habitat type is as abundant at the sites where the species occurs as it is across all sampled sites; increasingly positive values show that the habitat type is used disproportionately more than its overall availability; a negative value means that it is relatively underused by the species. 3.3.2 Limitations In addition to the limitations listed for the full habitat models, uncertainty is extreme in the use-availability figures due to the small sample sizes for these poorly detected species. We also do not have enough data to separate out confounded effects of geographic or climatic distributions from habitat preferences. For example, a species with a southern range will have higher use-availability indices for grass, shrub and deciduous forest, which are more common in the south, even if it does not really prefer these types to conifer forest. The figures are simply intended to summarize habitat and human footprint use information in our data for these rarer species. They should not be interpreted as general habitat models for the species. "],["predictive-maps.html", "4 Predictive maps 4.1 Systematic sites 4.2 Methods 4.3 Reporting Regions 4.4 Limitations", " 4 Predictive maps 4.1 Systematic sites Habitat association models, plus models describing how species varied spatially and with climate gradients were used to predict species abundance in 1 km2 spatial units under reference and current conditions. We present the following figures: Predicted relative abundance throughout Alberta under reference conditions. Habitat association models, plus models describing how species varied spatially and with climate gradients were used to predict species abundance in 1 km2 spatial units under reference conditions. Predictions of relative abundance of species in each 1 km2 unit were made after all human footprint in the 1 km2 unit had been backfilled based on native vegetation in the surrounding area. Predicted relative abundance throughout Alberta under current conditions. Habitat association models, plus models describing how species varied spatially and with climate gradients were used to predict species abundance in 1 km2 spatial units under current conditions. Predictions of relative species abundance in each 1 km2 unit were made based on the vegetation and human footprint present in the 1 km2 unit under current conditions (2018 Human Footprint). Difference in relative abundance between current and reference conditions. For each 1 km2 unit the difference between predicted current and reference conditions was determined. The reference (left), current (center), and differnce (right) maps for an example species. 4.2 Methods Province-wide maps are generated by applying the models of a species relationship with vegetation or soil types, human footprint, geographic location and climate to a set of 1 km2 pixels covering the province. Within each pixel, the proportion of each vegetation or soil and human footprint type in the 1 km2 area is determined, along with the latitude, longitude and climate values at the centre of the pixel. The current maps summarize information from the current landbase, including current human footprint (2018 human footprint). The reference maps summarize information from a back-filled map, in which footprint has been removed and replaced with the vegetation type that was expected prior to the footprint being created. Back-filling is based on adjacent vegetation types and rules about what vegetation types different footprint types can occur in (e.g., forestry occurs only in harvestable-age upland stands). The difference maps show the areas where the species is predicted to be higher or lower in the current map compared to the reference map. For species with both vegetation and soil based models, we weight the predictions in regions where either model would be suitable (i.e., Parkland and Dry mixedwood). This weight is based on the probability an area support trees (pAspen), the amount of unknown soil (pSoil), and the amount of treed areas (pFor). \\(North weight = \\frac{pAspen}{pAspen - (1-pFor)}\\) \\(South weight = (1-pAspen) * (1-pSoil) * (1-pFor)\\) We rescale these two weights (\\(North weight = \\frac{North weight}{North weight + South weight}\\)) so that: \\(South weight = North weight - 1\\). Distribution of weights used for averaging predictions created from the vegetation and soil based models. 4.3 Reporting Regions We summarize our SDM for two reporting regions: 1) The Forested region is composed of the Boreal, Canadian Shield, Rocky Mountain (excluding eastern portion of the Montane region), and Foothills natural regions in addition to the northern portion of the Dry Mixedwood natural subregion. These areas are predominately impacted by forestry footprint; 2) The Prairie region is composed of the Grassland and Parkland natural regions, the southern portion of the Dry Mixedwood natural subregion, and the eastern portion of the Montane natural subregion. These areas were grouped together due to agriculture being the predominate anthropogenic disturbance. The boundaries of the forested and prairie reporting regions used for calculating sector effects. 4.4 Limitations There are several limitations to ABMI species maps: The maps are based on predicted habitat quality. They show the average expected abundance of a species given the habitat types, footprint, geographic location and climate of the 1 km2 area. We do not know the actual abundances of each species in each of the 1 km2 area in the province. There are many variables beyond habitat quality that determine why a species may be absent or rare at a particular place where we predict it to be common, and vice versa. There is uncertainty in the habitat models for each species. Uncertainty of habitat models is high for rarer species and for rarer habitat types. Uncertainty is also higher in the corners of the province, particularly the northwest and southwest, where we have limited sampling and are extrapolating from our models. Accompanying uncertainty maps show the absolute prediction uncertainty across the province. The map predictions are most accurate at broad regional scales. At smaller scales, the true abundance of the species can vary from the prediction, because many factors beyond habitat quality affect a species. At small scales  individual pixels through townships  the maps show the habitat quality for the species, but should not be interpreted as showing the actual abundance of the species in that small area. The underlying vegetation maps used to make the predictions are imperfect. There are classification errors in some places with greater errors for some particular habitat types (e.g., grass and shrub, mixedwood), and areas missing some of the input layers particularly outside of commercial forestry areas. We make assumptions about stand ages in about 1/3 of the forest area that is missing that information. Human footprint is more accurate, but may be 2 or 3 years out of date. Reference maps only show the effects of statistically removing the effects of visible human footprint. They do not show how the species would have been distributed under pristine, natural or pre-historic conditions. Current maps do not show effects of other human disturbances, like pollution, cattle grazing, climate change or changes on wintering grounds for migratory species. "],["sector-effects.html", "5 Sector Effects 5.1 Methods", " 5 Sector Effects The effect of a sector on a species is the product of the area of the sectors footprint (width of the bars), and the average per unit area effect of that sectors footprint on the species (height of the bars). The area of footprint for a sector is the sum of the footprint belonging to it. The average effect is the difference between the predicted current and reference abundances in that sectors footprint type based on the species model. The unit, (left), regional (center), and under footprint (right) effects for Balsam Fir. 5.1 Methods We calculate the effects of different industrial sectors by predicting the abundance of each species in the current land base versus a land base in which the footprint associated with a particular industrial sector has been back-filled. Back-filling means replacing that sectors footprint with the vegetation or soil type that would have been present before the footprint was made. The difference between the total predicted population in the current and the back-filled land base is the predicted effect of that sector on the abundance of a species in the region. For the sector effect figures, we express the effect as the percent population change per unit area of the sectors footprint (height of the bar). The width of the bar for each sector shows the total area of the region occupied by that sectors footprint. The height multiplied by the width of the bar (i.e., the area of the bar = the effect per unit area of footprint multiplied by the area of footprint) is the total effect of the sector on the population of the species in the region. A bar with a large area means that that sector has had a large effect on the population  increasing the population if the bar is above 0, decreasing it if the bar is below 0. The effect of an industrial sector on a species is determined by three factors: 1) How much area is occupied by the footprint of that sector, 2) How strongly  positively or negatively, or a mix of both  the species responds to each of the sectors footprint types, 3) How much of the sectors footprint is in higher- versus lower-quality habitat for the species. For example, a species that lives in old upland forest may be more affected by the forestry sector than the energy sector, because forestry focuses on those older merchantable stands. "],["intactness.html", "6 Intactness 6.1 Limitations", " 6 Intactness ABMIs intactness is a measure of how much human footprint has affected species abundances. We first use habitat models for each species to estimate its relative abundance in the current land base, and in a reference land base in which human footprint has been removed and back-filled with the vegetation that was there prior to the footprint. If the species is predicted to be less abundant in the current land base than in the reference, intactness is defined as current abundance / reference abundance × 100%. An intactness of 80%, for example, would mean that the species is currently at 80% of the abundance expected in the reference land base with no footprint. If the species is predicted to be more abundant in the current land base, intactness is calculated as reference abundance / current abundance X 100%. In that case, an intactness of 80% would mean that the species is currently 1.25 times as abundant as expected in the reference land base (1/1.25 × 100% = 80%). Intactness therefore declines as the current abundance differs from the reference abundance, regardless of whether the species is predicted to be less or more abundant currently. Intactness of a taxon, like vascular plants, is simply the average of the intactness of each species we can analyse in that taxon. Biodiversity intactness is the simple average of intactness for the 6 taxa modeled by the ABMI: birds, mammals, amphibians, mites, vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens. Because any difference between current and reference, positive or negative, lowers intactness of a species, species that increase with human footprint do not cancel out species that decrease with footprint. For intactness maps, we calculate the intactness in each 1 km2 pixel covering the province. For tables that summarize intactness for particular regions, we calculate each species current and reference abundance by summing the 1 km2 raster values in the region, then calculate intactness for the species from those totals. Species intactness values are then averaged to give the intactness of the taxon for the region, and the taxa are averaged for biodiversity intactness. Intactness uses the total current and reference population in a reporting region. One human footprint type can have a positive effect on a species in a region and another type have a negative effect. These offsetting effects would keep intactness relatively high for that species, even though each footprint type has an effect. 6.1 Limitations Because intactness is based on the models for each species, it incorporates the limitations of those models. However, intactness is an average across many species, making error in individual species models less important. A main limitation is that intactness is largely a function of human footprint. Maps of intactness are therefore highly correlated with maps of human footprint, regardless of the taxon. Intactness maps differ from human footprint maps only because some footprint types have greater or lesser effects on species in a taxon. Intactness does not show how much species have changed over time, because many factors besides habitat change due to human footprint can change species populations.
