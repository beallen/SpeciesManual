<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Full habitat models for relatively common species, systematic (non-wetland) sites</h2>
<p>Models are used to show how species, relative abundance differed among vegetation, soil and, human footprint types in the northern, and southern regions of Alberta. Models were only created for species that had enough detections. The following figures are presented to describe habitat associations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Species–habitat associations in northern Alberta.</strong> Predicted species abundance in each vegetation and human footprint type is shown with bars. Vertical lines indicate 90% confidence intervals. Dots within the forested habitat types show predicted species abundance in forest harvest areas of various ages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Species–habitat associations in southern Alberta.</strong> Due to climate and soil conditionsnatural disturbances and vegetation succession, varying amounts of aspen and other trees may be present on each soil type in the south (Non-treed sites and Treed sites); the presence/absence of trees greatly affects the presence and abundance of many other biota. Separate figures are presented for south Non-treed sites and Treed sites. Predicted species abundance in each soil/human footprint type is shown with bars. Vertical lines indicate 90% confidence intervals.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Linear footprint relationships in northern Alberta.</strong> For linear footprint in northern Alberta, the pairs of points show the change expected from the average habitat with no linear footprint when 10% linear footprint is added.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Linear footprint relationships in southern Alberta.</strong> For linear footprint in southern Alberta, the pairs of points show the change expected from the average habitat with no linear footprint when 10% linear footprint is added.</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="methods" class="section level3" number="3.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Methods</h3>
<p>We use a set of statistical models to relate the relative abundance of each species measured at ABMI sites to two sets of variables: vegetation or human footprint type, and geographic location or climate variables. The analyses are done separately for two overlapping regions: North (boreal, foothills, Canadian shield, parkland), and South (grasslands, parkland, dry mixedwood subregion of the boreal).</p>
<p>Relative abundance for vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens is the probability that the species will occur in a 50 m x 50 m ABMI quadrat, or a soil sample for mites. For birds, relative abundance is the number of birds detected a point count, adjusted for the species’ detection distance and standardized for other sampling variables. For mammals, we are using winter snow-track transect data, with relative abundance being the probability of finding the animal’s tracks on a 1-km segment 5 days after a snowfall. These are the values on the y-axis of the habitat model figures, and in the coefficient tables. We also model the number of non-native vascular plant species, besides individual vacular plant species.</p>
<p>Vegetation types in the North region are based on several province-wide GIS layers of vegetation variables, and include main forest stand types (white spruce, pine, deciduous, mixedwood, black spruce) by broad age classes (0-9 years, 10-19 years, then 20-year classes to 140+ years) and several categories of open vegetation (larch fens, upland grass, upland shrub, wet grass, and wet shrub). In the South, ‘vegetation types’ are broad soil types, such as productive, rapid draining, etc. The South models also include a term for the probability that the site is or was naturally treed. Open wetlands are sampled and modeled separately.</p>
<p>Several categories of human footprint are distinguished in the models, including cultivation (typically forage or tame pasture in the North and crops in the South), urban/industrial, forestry, soft (vegetated) linear features and hard (unvegetated) linear features. Forestry footprint is differentiated by broad stand type and the same age classes as natural forest (although we have few samples in forestry areas &gt;20 years old).</p>
<p>The scale of the vegetation or soils and human footprint information used in the models is a square 1-ha area for plants, lichens, mosses and mites.</p>
<p>Flexible relationships with latitude, longitude and a set of broad climate variables are also included in the models to represent the geographic and climatic distribution of the species. The bioclimatic variables used in the modeling were calculated at a 4-km resolution using monthly climate normals of temperature and precipitation averaged over 1961-1990.</p>
<p>The analysis is conducted in a ‘model selection framework,’ which means that the models for each species are only as complex as the data for that species support. For example, the models for a rarer species with few records may not be able to separate different age classes or even broad stand types. All age classes or several stand types therefore have the same average value in the resulting habitat model. This does not mean that there are truly no differences between these types for that species. It just means that we do not yet have enough data to estimate abundances in all those individual vegetation types.</p>
<p>This habitat modeling requires moderate sample sizes, so we can only do the analyses for species found in at least 20 sites in an analysis region.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level3" number="3.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Limitations</h3>
<p>There are many limitations and caveats about the use of these habitat models:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>We use simple abundance measures.</strong> For vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens and mites, we are only analyzing occurrence of the species at 0-4 of the 4 quadrats or soil samples per site. The number of individuals, percent cover, total volume or biomass, reproductive status, etc. of the species is not part of this measure — a single sapling of a tree species is an occurrence counted as much as complete cover of large trees. There is also no adjustment for the probability that the species was present but was missed by the field technicians. That probability is probably higher in complicated quadrats, species rich habitats, rare species, and for groups of species that are hard to distinguish in the field, all of which could affect the habitat models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There is often high uncertainty in individual values.</strong> The confidence intervals on individual habitat values for a species are often wide, and should be integral to any use of the habitat models. There are two main reasons for wide uncertainty in our results: 1) We estimate values for many habitat and human footprint types, particularly in the North, with many combinations of broad stand types and age classes. Ideally we would have hundreds of observations of a species to estimate so many values. Instead, we use a fairly complicated modeling procedure to extract reasonable values for many species with lower sample sizes by simplifying the complexity of habitat types. For all but the most common species, the resulting habitat models are simplified (some habitat types are assumed to be the same) and estimated with large error. 2) ABMI sites are systematically located, and the Alberta landbase often contains a fine-scale mix of several habitat types and human footprint. Individual sites, even 1-ha areas, therefore usually fall in more than one habitat and/or human footprint type. Our models are designed to separate out the effects of each individual habitat or human footprint type as best as possible, but the analysis is necessarily imperfect with limited sample sizes. A highly specialised species, for example, will almost inevitably show some predicted abundance in habitat types that it does not use, when these co-occur with preferred habitat types.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The explanatory variables are confounded.</strong> We have limited ability to separate effects of each vegetation and human footprint type, and spatial and climate variables. In addition to the challenges generating uncertainty in the individual values, ABMI is not an experimental study. We do not design and manipulate habitat and human footprint types, and simply use what is sampled in the province. As a result, habitat and human footprint types are partially confounded with geographic location and climate variables. Our modeling separate out these effects as best as possible, but without impossible province-wide experiments, we can never be sure how well we have estimated the separate habitat, human footprint and geographic/climate effects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We use the same model set for all species.</strong> Our model selection approach weights different models in a model set based on the support provided by each species’ data. However, we use the same set of models for all species. We currently do not have the resources to develop separate model sets for individual species to benefit from the differences in natural history.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>There are errors in species identification.</strong> All taxa have potential for errors in species identification, including the mammal track surveys and the bird recording interpretation. Taxonomic issues are common with the plants, bryophytes, and lichens, where many species groups are difficult to distinguish and taxonomy changes frequently. This adds to uncertainty in models for some species.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The vegetation and soil classification is simplified and contains errors.</strong> ABMI’s vegetation map is compiled from various sources, not all of which cover the entire province. Some layers are less accurate than others. Also, even if individual polygons are accurate, their boundaries may not be precise, and many ABMI sites fall on the edges of vegetation polygons. Resulting error in the vegetation types at sites increases error in the habitat models. Some habitat types may have additional challenges. Grass and shrub sites in the North, for example, may be true permanent open habitats, but the same designation is often given to early seral stages of forested sites after fire. Grass and shrub sites in the prairies are also poorly mapped. Mixedwood stands are also poorly mapped, because they represent a gradient between deciduous and upland conifer stands, which can often change as a stand ages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The soil classification currently uses only broad groupings of individual soil types.</strong> Few species show strong responses to soil type in our models, suggesting that these groups may not be well-defined or relevant to many species. We have too few sites to treat lowland sites in the South separately.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We have only broad classes of human footprint.</strong> Human footprint is generally mapped more precisely than vegetation, but we use only broad groups of footprint types. Industrial sites and urban or rural residential areas, for example, cannot be reliably distinguished. Values are particularly difficult to estimate reliably for linear features, because these usually occupy only a small portion of a site. We also have few sites with older forestry cutblocks. Values for those habitat types combine our rough estimates with an assumed rate of convergence of aging forestry and natural stands.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No other effects of human activities are included in our models.</strong> Many sites in the South are grazed to varying degrees but this information is not available. Thus grazing effects cannot be included in our models, and if grazing differs among native habitat types the effects confound those difference. Any wide-scale human effects, like pollution away from visible human footprint or recent climate change, are also not included in our modeling. Additionally, we only include effects of footprint at the local scale — the 1-ha scale we sample at, or larger sampling areas for birds and mammals. Due to sample size constraints and confounding among variables, we do not include any additional effects that might be caused by human footprint in the larger surrounding area.</p></li>

<div id="use-availability-summaries-for-rarer-species" class="section level2" number="3.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Use-availability summaries for rarer species</h2>
<p>If it was not possible to create complex habitat association models for species, we present a coarse index of habitat use the proportion of detections in each native vegetation and human footprint type in comparison to the proportional availability of the habitat types.</p>
<div id="methods-1" class="section level3" number="3.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Methods</h3>
<p>ABMI has information on many species that are detected too few times for full habitat models. For species detected at 3 or more sites but less than 20 sites, we summarize habitat and human footprint use with a simple use-availability index. The index is based on the proportions of each broad habitat or human footprint type in the sites where the species is present versus the proportions of habitat and human footprint type across all sites that we have sampled. A value of 0 for a habitat type means that the habitat type is as abundant at the sites where the species occurs as it is across all sampled sites; increasingly positive values show that the habitat type is used disproportionately more than its overall availability; a negative value means that it is relatively underused by the species.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitations-1" class="section level3" number="3.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Limitations</h3>
<p>In addition to the limitations listed for the full habitat models, uncertainty is extreme in the use-availability figures due to the small sample sizes for these poorly detected species. We also do not have enough data to separate out confounded effects of geographic or climatic distributions from habitat preferences. For example, a species with a southern range will have higher use-availability indices for grass, shrub and deciduous forest, which are more common in the south, even if it does not really prefer these types to conifer forest. The figures are simply intended to summarize habitat and human footprint use information in our data for these rarer species. They should not be interpreted as general habitat models for the species.</p>
