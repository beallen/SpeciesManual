# ABMI Species Manual for Lichens, Mosses, Vascular Plants, and Soil Mites

## Overview

The Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI) has developed a monitoring program for lichens, mosses, vascular plants, and soil mites in Alberta. This repository contains a **bookdown** document (https://beallen.github.io/SpeciesManual/) describing how data was collected, processed, and analysed. This technical document will be updated as necessary while the most recent species results can be found on the ABMI Biodiversity Browser (https://www.abmi.ca/home/data-analytics/biobrowser-home).
